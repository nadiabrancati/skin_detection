# Adaptive rule based skin detector

A skin detection method based on a dynamic generation of the skin cluster range in the YCbCr color space by taking into account the lighting conditions. The method is based both on the identification of skin color clusters in the YCb and YCr subspaces and on the definition of correlation rules between the skin color clusters; it is efficient in terms of computational effort.

The code is free to use for research, provided that the following paper is cited in the works that use the code: Brancati N., De Pietro G., Frucci M., Gallo L., "Human skin detection through correlation rules between the YCb and YCr
subspaces based on dynamic color clustering", Computer Vision and Image Understanding (submitted)

How to use:

For Windows OS: run skin.exe. In command line, insert the path of the test image, for example "image1.jpg" and "image2.jpg".

For Linux OS: go in command line. In the directory where the executable object fine is installed (skin), copy this string "./skin image1.jpg" for the image1, or this string "./skin image2.jpg" for the image2.
