# Adaptive_rule_based_skin_detector

A skin detection method based on a dynamic generation of the skin cluster range in the YCbCr color space by taking into account the lighting conditions. The method is based both on the identification of skin color clusters in the YCb and YCr subspaces and on the definition of correlation rules between the skin color clusters; it is efficient in terms of computational effort.

The code is free to use for research, provided that the following paper is cited in the works that use the code: Brancati N., De Pietro G., Frucci M., Gallo L., "Human skin detection through correlation rules between the YCb and YCr
subspaces based on dynamic color clustering", Computer Vision and Image Understanding (submitted)
