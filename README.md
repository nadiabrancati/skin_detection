# skin_detection
A novel algorithm for skin detection


This algorithm is the implementation of a novel skin detection method based on a dynamic generation of the skin cluster range
in the YCbCr color space by taking into account the lighting conditions. The method is based both on the
identification of skin color clusters in the YCb and YCr subspaces and on the definition of correlation rules
between the skin color clusters. The objective was to design a rule-based skin detector efficient in terms
of computational effort and robust against severe variation in illumination conditions.
